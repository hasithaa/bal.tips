# Ballerina Value Universe

The universe of Ballerina is composed of a variety of value types, forming the backbone of this robust programming language. Data values include fundamental types such as `int`, `boolean`, and `string`. Structured values encompass arrays, lists, maps, and records, providing a rich platform for data organization. Behavior values, including functions, objects, and services, underpin dynamic interactions within the language. This expansive spectrum of values is what elevates Ballerina to its status as a powerful tool in programming.
