>> "Code never lies, comments sometimes do." 
<em>- Ron Jeffries</em>

Rarely, you write perfect code and runs forever. Coding is an iterative process; You need to add new features, improve your code, and fix bugs. So you have to continue reading your old code and to know how/where to fix it. 

So write your code in a self-documenting or understandable way. Put comments if necessary. Don't make updating comments in sync with the source code is an excessive task.
