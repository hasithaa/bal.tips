{{<md class="summary">}}
The `never` type describes the type that does not contain any shape. Hence there is no value in Ballerina values space that belongs to the never type. This is different from *nil*, where *nil* describes the absence of any value and it has a single value called *nil*. The never type is useful for indicating that a function will never return a value.
