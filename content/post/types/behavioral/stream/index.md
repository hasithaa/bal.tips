{{<md class="summary">}}
A stream is a value that can produce a sequence of values. Streams are used by many standard library functions to present a sequence of values sourced from a file, message queue, or database table, etc. It is composed of two primitive operations: "next" and "close". The "next" operation retrieves values from the sequence (similar to the "next" method of an iterator), while the "close" operation closes the stream, releasing its resources.
